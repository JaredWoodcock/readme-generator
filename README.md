# Professional README Generator
Module 9 Challenge - Professional README Generator

In this challenge, I completed starter code to create a professional README generator.
<ul>When prompted for information about my application repository, then a README is generated with the title of the projects and multiple sections.</ul>
<ul>When I enter the project title, then that is displayed as the title of the README.</ul>
<ul>When I enter in the information for all the other sections, then it is placed in the appropriate sections.</ul>
<ul>When a project license is chosen, then the license badge and a link to the license is given in the license section, as well as an explanation to which license the application is covered under.</ul>
<ul>When my GitHub username is entered, then it is added to the Questions section with a link to my GitHub profile.</ul>
<ul>When my email address is entered, then it is added to the Questions section with instructions on how to reach me.</ul>
<ul>When links in the table of contents are clicked, then it takes you to the corresponding section of the README.</ul>
